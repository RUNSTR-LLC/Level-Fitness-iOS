# Level Fitness Database Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Production Database Setup

This guide will walk you through deploying the complete Level Fitness database schema to your Supabase project.

### Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Project**: Already created with URL `https://cqhlwoguxbwnqdternci.supabase.co`
2. **Database Access**: Admin access to your Supabase SQL editor
3. **Apple Authentication**: Sign in with Apple already configured

### Step 1: Deploy Database Schema

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) 
   - Navigate to your `level-fitness` project
   - Go to SQL Editor

2. **Run Schema SQL**
   - Copy the entire contents of `supabase_schema.sql`
   - Paste into a new SQL query in Supabase
   - Click "Run" to execute

   This will create:
   - âœ… 11 production tables with proper relationships
   - âœ… 15+ database indexes for performance
   - âœ… 4 leaderboard views for complex queries
   - âœ… Complete Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - âœ… Automated triggers and functions
   - âœ… Sample data for testing

### Step 2: Verify Database Setup

Run these queries in the SQL Editor to verify everything is working:

```sql
-- Check tables were created
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND rowsecurity = true;

-- Check sample teams exist
SELECT name, member_count, created_at FROM teams;

-- Check sample events exist  
SELECT name, type, status, prize_pool FROM events;
```

Expected results:
- **11 tables**: profiles, teams, team_members, workouts, challenges, events, etc.
- **11 RLS-enabled tables**: All tables should have `rowsecurity = true`
- **5 sample teams**: Level Fitness Beginners, Daily Grinders, etc.
- **3 sample events**: January Marathon Challenge, etc.

### Step 3: Configure Storage Buckets

1. **Go to Storage** in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Create Avatars Bucket**:
   - Name: `avatars`
   - Public: Yes
   - File size limit: 5MB
   - Allowed MIME types: `image/*`

3. **Create Team Images Bucket**:
   - Name: `team-images`  
   - Public: Yes
   - File size limit: 10MB
   - Allowed MIME types: `image/*`

### Step 4: Configure Real-time

1. **Go to Database â†’ Replication**
2. **Enable replication** for these tables:
   - âœ… `team_messages` (for chat)
   - âœ… `workouts` (for live leaderboards)
   - âœ… `event_participants` (for live event updates)
   - âœ… `transactions` (for payment notifications)

### Step 5: Test Authentication Integration

The schema includes automatic profile creation when users sign up with Apple:

```sql
-- This trigger runs automatically on signup:
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
    AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_new_user();
```

**To test:**
1. Build and run the iOS app
2. Sign in with Apple
3. Check that a profile was created:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, username, full_name, created_at FROM profiles;
   ```

### Step 6: Production Security Review

#### âœ… Row Level Security Policies

All tables have comprehensive RLS policies:

- **Profiles**: Users can update own profile, everyone can view basic info
- **Teams**: Public teams visible to all, members see private teams  
- **Workouts**: Users see own workouts, teammates see each other's
- **Transactions**: Users only see their own transactions
- **Messages**: Team members only see their team's messages

#### âœ… Database Performance

Optimized indexes on:
- User lookups: `idx_profiles_username`
- Workout queries: `idx_workouts_user_id`, `idx_workouts_started_at`
- Team operations: `idx_team_members_team_id`
- Transaction history: `idx_transactions_user_id`

#### âœ… Data Integrity

Automated triggers maintain:
- Team member counts when users join/leave
- User statistics when workouts are synced
- Streak tracking when activities are logged
- Updated timestamps on profile changes

### Step 7: Lightning Wallet Integration

The database is ready for Bitcoin Lightning integration:

1. **Lightning Wallets Table**: Stores encrypted wallet credentials
2. **Transactions Table**: Tracks all Bitcoin rewards and payments  
3. **Automated Triggers**: Update user earnings when transactions complete

Example wallet creation:
```sql
INSERT INTO lightning_wallets (user_id, provider, wallet_id, address, balance)
VALUES ('user-uuid', 'coinos', 'coinos-wallet-id', 'username@coinos.io', 0);
```

### Step 8: Monitoring & Analytics

#### Built-in Leaderboard Views

Query weekly leaders:
```sql
SELECT username, workout_count, total_points, rank 
FROM weekly_leaderboard 
LIMIT 10;
```

Query team rankings:
```sql
SELECT team_name, member_count, total_points, rank
FROM team_leaderboard  
LIMIT 10;
```

#### User Statistics Dashboard

Get comprehensive user stats:
```sql
SELECT username, total_workouts, recent_workouts_7d, active_streaks
FROM user_stats 
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid';
```

### Step 9: iOS App Integration

The iOS app is already configured with enhanced SupabaseService methods:

- **Competition Methods**: `fetchEvents()`, `joinEvent()`, `fetchEventParticipants()`
- **Lightning Methods**: `createLightningWallet()`, `fetchTransactions()`
- **Social Methods**: `fetchTeamMessages()`, `sendTeamMessage()` 
- **Leaderboard Methods**: `fetchWeeklyLeaderboard()`, `fetchTeamLeaderboard()`

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **RLS Policy Errors**
   ```
   Error: new row violates row-level security policy
   ```
   **Solution**: Check that `auth.uid()` matches the user_id in your request

2. **Missing Tables**
   ```
   Error: relation "table_name" does not exist  
   ```
   **Solution**: Re-run the schema SQL, check for syntax errors

3. **Authentication Issues**
   ```
   Error: JWT expired
   ```
   **Solution**: Refresh the user session in your iOS app

4. **Real-time Not Working**
   ```
   Error: Realtime subscription failed
   ```
   **Solution**: Check that replication is enabled for the table

### Support

For issues with this database setup:
1. Check Supabase logs in Dashboard â†’ Logs
2. Verify RLS policies are correctly configured
3. Test queries directly in SQL Editor
