# Team Marketplace Vision

## Executive Summary

**RunstrRewards Team Marketplace** transforms the app from simple team subscriptions into a dynamic competitive economy where users strategically switch between teams to maximize Bitcoin earnings, while RunstrRewards profits from switching friction through exit fees.

### Core Business Model Shift
- **From**: Static team subscriptions ($1.99/month per member)
- **To**: Dynamic marketplace with exit fees (2,000 sats per team switch) + team loyalty programs
- **Result**: Users become strategic "free agents" optimizing earnings across teams

---

## Business Model & Revenue Streams

### Primary Revenue: Exit Fees
- **2,000 sats per team switch** paid directly to RunstrRewards lightning address
- Users pay from CoinOS wallet ‚Üí RunstrRewards hardcoded lightning address
- No complex wallet infrastructure needed (simplified implementation)

### Secondary Revenue: Enhanced Team Competition
- Teams compete for top performers through loyalty bonuses
- Higher team engagement = more events = more Bitcoin flowing through ecosystem
- Teams invest more in member retention and rewards

### Economic Psychology
- Exit fee creates switching friction but justified by earning potential
- Users will pay 2k sats believing they'll earn it back on better teams
- Teams must prove value through loyalty programs to retain talent

## Business Impact Projections

### Revenue Modeling
- **100 active users** switching teams 2x/month = **400k sats/month** exit fee revenue
- **1,000 active users** = **4M sats/month** = ~$1,600 monthly recurring revenue
- Plus existing team subscription revenue + loyalty program circulation

### User Behavior Changes
- Strategic team evaluation becomes core user behavior
- Teams invest in member experience to reduce churn
- Higher-stakes decision making increases engagement
- Users become more active to justify exit fee investments

2. **Implement Feature 1** (Enhanced Discovery) - Drives marketplace behavior  
3. **Add Feature 3** (Loyalty Programs) - Team retention tools
4. **Complete with Feature 4** (Analytics) - User optimization tools
