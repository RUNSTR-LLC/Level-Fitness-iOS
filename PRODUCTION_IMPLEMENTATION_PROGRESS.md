## Current Architecture Strengths

The app already has a solid foundation that positions it well for rapid completion:

1. **Thread-Safe Services**: All core services (KeychainService, CoinOSService, etc.) are properly synchronized
2. **Real Bitcoin Integration**: Unlike demo apps, this uses actual Lightning Network transactions
3. **Production-Ready Subscriptions**: Full StoreKit implementation with proper validation
4. **Comprehensive HealthKit**: Advanced duplicate detection and cross-platform sync
5. **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and maintain with clean component architecture

The remaining work is primarily about connecting existing components into automated workflows rather than building new functionality from scratch.
