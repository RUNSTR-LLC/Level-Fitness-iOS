# RunstrRewards: Production-Ready Checklist

## Overview
RunstrRewards is 95% production-ready with comprehensive features implemented. This document tracks the final tasks needed to launch the "invisible micro app" for team-based fitness competitions with real Bitcoin rewards.

## 🚨 **CRITICAL (Address Immediately)**

### 1. **Security: Remove Hardcoded Credentials**
- [ ] **Issue**: `SupabaseService.swift` contains hardcoded API keys and database URLs
- [ ] **Impact**: Critical security vulnerability - credentials exposed in source code
- [ ] **Solution Tasks**:
  - [ ] Move Supabase URL to `.xcconfig` file or `Info.plist`
  - [ ] Move Supabase anon key to secure configuration
  - [ ] Create build configurations for dev/staging/prod environments
  - [ ] Update code to use `Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: "SUPABASE_URL")`
  - [ ] Test configuration loading in all build environments

### 2. **File Size Refactoring: Break Down Oversized Files** 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- [x] **Issue**: Multiple files violate 500-line guideline
- [x] **Created comprehensive refactoring plan**: `file-refactoring-plan.md`
- [ ] **Files Over Limit**:
  - [ ] `SupabaseService.swift`: 2,139 lines (328% over limit) - **Phase 1 Priority**
  - [ ] `TeamDetailViewController.swift`: 1,486 lines (197% over limit) - **Phase 2 Priority**
  - [ ] `SubscriptionService.swift`: 1,208 lines (142% over limit) - **Phase 3 Priority**
  - [ ] `SettingsViewController.swift`: 1,122 lines (124% over limit) - **Phase 4 Priority**
  - [ ] `ViewController.swift`: 1,047 lines (109% over limit) - **Phase 5 Priority**

- [ ] **Phase 1: SupabaseService Refactoring** (3-4 days):
  - [x] Create `AuthDataService.swift` (~190 lines) ✅ Build successful
  - [ ] Create `TeamDataService.swift` (~500 lines)
  - [ ] Create `WorkoutDataService.swift` (~400 lines)
  - [ ] Create `CompetitionDataService.swift` (~400 lines)
  - [ ] Create `TransactionDataService.swift` (~300 lines)
  - [ ] Keep `SupabaseService.swift` as coordinator (~200 lines)
  - [ ] Update imports and dependencies across codebase
  - [ ] Test all functionality after refactoring

## ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY (Address This Sprint)**

### 3. **Data Validation: Add Comprehensive Input Validation**
- [ ] **Issue**: Missing validation throughout the app
- [ ] **Create ValidationService.swift**:
  - [ ] `validateTeamName(_ name: String) throws -> String`
  - [ ] `validateUsername(_ username: String) throws -> String`
  - [ ] `validateEmail(_ email: String) throws -> String`
  - [ ] `validateBitcoinAddress(_ address: String) throws -> String`
  - [ ] `sanitizeUserInput(_ input: String) -> String`
- [ ] **Add Validation Points**:
  - [ ] Team creation wizard
  - [ ] User profile setup
  - [ ] Competition event creation
  - [ ] Chat message input
  - [ ] Wallet operations

### 4. **Error Recovery: Complete Missing Critical Implementations**
- [ ] **Issue**: Found placeholder implementations in critical areas
- [ ] **Complete Bitcoin Transaction Recording**:
  - [ ] Implement full transaction recording in `SupabaseService.swift`
  - [ ] Remove "For MVP: Simple logging implementation" placeholder
  - [ ] Add proper database storage for all Bitcoin transactions
- [ ] **Complete Competition Features**:
  - [ ] Find and complete any remaining "TODO" implementations
  - [ ] Test all competition workflows end-to-end
- [ ] **Add Error Recovery Logic**:
  - [ ] Network failure recovery for critical operations
  - [ ] Retry mechanisms for wallet operations
  - [ ] Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### 5. **Centralized Configuration: Create Extensions Directory**
- [ ] **Issue**: Common utilities scattered across files
- [ ] **Create Extensions Directory**:
  - [ ] `Extensions/Date+Extensions.swift` (centralized date formatting)
  - [ ] `Extensions/Notification+Extensions.swift` (all NSNotification.Name definitions)
  - [ ] `Extensions/String+Validation.swift` (common string operations)
  - [ ] `Extensions/UIView+IndustrialDesign.swift` (common UI styling)
  - [ ] `Extensions/UIColor+Theme.swift` (centralized color definitions)
- [ ] **Refactor Existing Code**:
  - [ ] Move scattered notification names to centralized file
  - [ ] Consolidate repeated date formatting logic
  - [ ] Update all files to use centralized extensions

## 🔶 **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next Sprint)**

### 6. **Race Condition Protection: Add Concurrency Controls**
- [ ] **Issue**: Potential race conditions in critical operations
- [ ] **Areas to Fix**:
  - [ ] Team member count updates (atomic operations)
  - [ ] Wallet balance modifications (optimistic locking)
  - [ ] Competition leaderboard updates (queue-based updates)
  - [ ] Background sync operations (prevent duplicate syncs)
- [ ] **Implementation**:
  - [ ] Add database-level constraints where possible
  - [ ] Implement optimistic locking for critical updates
  - [ ] Add proper async/await synchronization

### 7. **Navigation Flow Testing: Add Comprehensive Navigation Tests**
- [ ] **Issue**: Complex navigation patterns need validation
- [ ] **Test Scenarios**:
  - [ ] Team Creation Wizard (all steps, back/forward navigation)
  - [ ] Event Creation Wizard (all steps, validation)
  - [ ] Deep linking to team pages via QR codes
  - [ ] Background-to-foreground state restoration
  - [ ] Profile setup flow completion
- [ ] **Implementation**:
  - [ ] Create UI tests for critical navigation paths
  - [ ] Test error states and recovery
  - [ ] Validate proper cleanup on navigation cancellation

### 8. **Memory Management: Audit Retain Cycles and Performance**
- [ ] **Issue**: Large view controllers and complex delegate chains
- [ ] **Audit Areas**:
  - [ ] All delegate pattern implementations (ensure weak references)
  - [ ] Image loading and caching in profile/team views
  - [ ] Background task cleanup and cancellation
  - [ ] HealthKit observer cleanup
- [ ] **Tools & Actions**:
  - [ ] Run Instruments memory profiling
  - [ ] Fix any identified retain cycles
  - [ ] Optimize image memory usage
  - [ ] Add proper cleanup in `deinit` methods

## 🔷 **LOWER PRIORITY (Future Improvements)**

### 9. **Performance Optimization: Implement Advanced Caching Strategy**
- [ ] **Current State**: Basic offline support exists
- [ ] **Enhancements**:
  - [ ] Smart cache invalidation for team/competition data
  - [ ] Preload critical data during app launch
  - [ ] Optimize HealthKit sync frequency based on user activity
  - [ ] Implement intelligent background sync scheduling
- [ ] **Implementation**:
  - [ ] Create comprehensive cache management system
  - [ ] Add cache performance metrics
  - [ ] Optimize for low-memory devices

### 10. **Developer Experience: Add Comprehensive API Documentation**
- [ ] **Issue**: Service classes lack detailed documentation
- [ ] **Add Documentation For**:
  - [ ] All SupabaseService (and future split services) public methods
  - [ ] AuthenticationService methods
  - [ ] HealthKitService methods
  - [ ] LightningWalletManager methods
  - [ ] All custom error types and their handling
- [ ] **Documentation Format**:
  ```swift
  /**
   * Creates a new team with the specified configuration
   * - Parameter team: Team data including name, description, and settings
   * - Throws: AppError.teamLimitReached if captain already has a team
   * - Returns: Created team with assigned database ID
   */
  ```
