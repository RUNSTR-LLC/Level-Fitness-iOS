## Risk Register 🚨

### High Risk Items
1. **App Store Rejection** - Financial features require extra scrutiny
   - Mitigation: Launch without real money initially
   
2. **HealthKit Permission Denial** - Users may not grant access
   - Mitigation: Manual workout entry option
   
3. **Payment Provider Issues** - Lightning is still emerging
   - Mitigation: Traditional payment fallback
   
4. **Scaling Issues** - Viral growth could overwhelm infrastructure
   - Mitigation: Auto-scaling, rate limiting, CDN

### Dependencies
- Supabase availability and pricing
- Apple Sign In approval
- Lightning Network stability
- Third-party API rate limits
- App Store review timeline
