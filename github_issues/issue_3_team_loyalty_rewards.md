# Team Loyalty Rewards & Retention Tools

## üéØ Feature Overview
Enable captains to create loyalty bonus programs that automatically reward members for staying on teams. This creates competitive differentiation between teams and reduces exit fee revenue by improving retention.

## üí∞ Business Logic
Teams compete for members by offering loyalty bonuses. Better loyalty programs = better member retention = competitive advantage in the marketplace.

## üìã Requirements

- [ ] Automatic distribution from team wallet

### Loyalty Program Types
- [ ] **Time-based**: Daily login bonuses, weekly participation rewards
- [ ] **Tenure-based**: 1 month, 3 month, 6 month milestone bonuses
- [ ] **Performance-based**: Top 3 members get bonus multipliers
- [ ] **Participation-based**: Workout frequency bonuses
- [ ] **Streak-based**: Consecutive day workout bonuses

### Member Loyalty Experience

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Team loyalty programs
CREATE TABLE team_loyalty_programs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    team_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id),
    program_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    program_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- daily, weekly, monthly, tenure, performance
    bonus_amount INTEGER NOT NULL, -- base bonus in sats
    multiplier_rules JSONB, -- flexible rules for multipliers
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Individual loyalty transactions
CREATE TABLE loyalty_transactions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id),
    team_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id),
    program_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES team_loyalty_programs(id),
    amount INTEGER NOT NULL, -- sats earned
    transaction_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- daily, weekly, tenure, performance
    earned_date DATE NOT NULL,
    distributed_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Member loyalty status tracking
CREATE TABLE member_loyalty_status (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id),
    team_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id),
    tenure_days INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    loyalty_tier TEXT DEFAULT 'bronze', -- bronze, silver, gold, platinum
    total_earned INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- lifetime loyalty sats earned
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Files to Modify
- `RunstrRewards/Features/Teams/TeamWalletViewController.swift` - Add loyalty program management
- `RunstrRewards/Services/TransactionDataService.swift` - Add loyalty distribution logic
- `RunstrRewards/Features/Teams/TeamDetailViewController.swift` - Display loyalty programs
- `RunstrRewards/Features/Profile/ProfileViewController.swift` - Show loyalty earnings
- New: `LoyaltyProgramService.swift` - Core loyalty logic

### Loyalty Calculation Engine
```swift
class LoyaltyProgramService {
    func calculateDailyBonuses(teamId: String) async throws
    func calculateWeeklyBonuses(teamId: String) async throws  
    func calculateTenureBonuses(userId: String, teamId: String) async throws
    func calculatePerformanceBonuses(teamId: String) async throws
    func distributeLoyaltyBonuses(teamId: String, bonuses: [LoyaltyBonus]) async throws
}
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] Teams with loyalty programs show higher retention rates
- [ ] Reduced exit fee payments (members stay longer)
- [ ] Captains actively create and manage loyalty programs
- [ ] Members report loyalty bonuses influence team selection
- [ ] Team wallet usage increases significantly

## üîÑ Automated Distribution Logic
```swift
// Daily loyalty distribution (runs as background job)
func distributeDailyLoyalty() async {
    let activePrograms = try await fetchActiveLoyaltyPrograms()
    
    for program in activePrograms {
        let eligibleMembers = try await getEligibleMembers(program)
        let bonuses = try await calculateBonuses(program, eligibleMembers)
        
        // Verify team wallet balance
        guard try await verifyWalletBalance(program.teamId, totalAmount: bonuses.sum) else {
            // Send low balance alert to captain
            continue
        }
        
        // Distribute bonuses
        try await distributeBonuses(bonuses)
        
        // Send notifications to members
        try await sendLoyaltyNotifications(bonuses)
    }
}
```
