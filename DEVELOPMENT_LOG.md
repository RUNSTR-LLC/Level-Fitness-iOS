## Recent Development Sessions

### August 26, 2024 - Agent Creation
**Focus**: Created lessons-learned-tracker agent system  
**Decisions**:
- Built comprehensive learning system to capture development insights
- Separated lessons learned from CLAUDE.md into dedicated documentation
- Created agent that monitors chat and commits for automatic lesson extraction

**Architecture Choices**:
- Used modular Python components for flexibility
- Integrated with existing CLAUDE.md structure for consistency
- Designed for both real-time monitoring and post-session analysis

**Next Steps**:
- Test agent on recent development sessions
- Integrate with daily development workflow
- Consider additional agent types for other repetitive tasks

### August 24, 2024 - Competitions Page Implementation
**Focus**: Complete competitions page with leaderboards and events  
**Architecture**: Broke down into 9 modular components under 500 lines each  
**Components Created**:
- CompetitionsViewController.swift
- CompetitionTabNavigationView.swift
- LeaderboardView.swift
- EventsView.swift
- LeaderboardItemView.swift
- EventCard.swift
- (3 additional supporting components)

**Technical Achievements**:
- Delegate pattern architecture scaling across 9 components
- Complex layout management for grid and list views
- Industrial design consistency maintained across all components

**Testing**: ✅ All navigation and interaction flows working

## Architecture Evolution

### File Organization Strategy
- **Target**: All files under 500 lines
- **Current Status**: 95% compliance
- **Pattern**: Feature-based folder structure with modular components
- **Benefit**: Easier debugging, testing, and maintenance

### Design System Maturity
- **Industrial Theme**: Fully established with bolts, gradients, rotating gears
- **Consistency**: Color palette, typography, spacing standardized
- **Reusability**: Components work across multiple view contexts

### Service Layer Architecture
- **Pattern**: Singleton services with clear responsibilities
- **Integration**: Clean separation between services and UI layers
- **Testing**: Each service can be tested independently

## Decision Log

### Why Lightning Network over Traditional Payments
**Date**: January 2024  
**Decision**: Use CoinOS Lightning Network instead of traditional payment processing  
**Rationale**: 
- Instant settlements vs. 3-5 day traditional transfers
- Micro-transaction friendly (workout rewards often <$1)
- Global accessibility without banking infrastructure
- Aligns with Bitcoin-native value proposition

### Why Team-Branded Notifications over App-Branded
**Date**: January 2024  
**Decision**: All push notifications feature team branding, not RunstrRewards  
**Rationale**:
- Members subscribe to teams, not to RunstrRewards directly
- Team loyalty drives engagement more than platform loyalty
- Invisible micro app philosophy - platform stays in background
- Teams are the customer-facing brand

### Why Background Sync over Manual Entry
**Date**: January 2024  
**Decision**: Automatic HealthKit sync instead of manual workout entry  
**Rationale**:
- Invisible micro app model - minimal user interaction required
- Higher data accuracy and completeness
- Better user experience - no additional work required
- Integrates with existing user workout habits and apps
